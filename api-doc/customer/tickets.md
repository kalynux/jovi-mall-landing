# Customer Tickets

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — the twelve customer routes and the `id`-vs-`_id` identifier rule, against `jovi-mall/src/modules/tickets/routes/customer-ticket.routes.ts` and `jovi-mall/src/core/base.schema.ts`. `ticket_number` was RULED OUT — no such path exists in `jovi-mall/src/`.

Support ticketing for **customers**. Same ticketing engine as the other roles — the same
`TicketController` / `TicketNoteController` / `TicketAttachmentController`, scoped to the caller.

- **Base path**: `/api/customer/tickets`
- **Auth**: Required · **Permissions**: `customer` only (`requireRole(['customer'])`)
- **Response envelope**: standard `{ success, data, meta?, message? }` — see [../README.md](../README.md#the-response-envelope-read-this-first).

> **Shared reference.** Payloads, enums, follower system and visibility rules are documented in
> [vendor/tickets.md](../vendor/tickets.md); the **authoritative enum values** are in
> [agency/tickets.md](../agency/tickets.md). This page lists the exact **customer** route set and the
> customer-specific restrictions.

> **The administrator on a ticket.** `assigned_admin` is **not** an actor summary — it is
> `{ name, job_title, department, avatar_url }`, and it is **`null` until a wi-admin
> administrator takes the ticket**, which is the state almost every ticket is in.
> `avatar_url` is **reserved and always `null`** — draw the initials from `name`. Full shape
> and the reasoning: [vendor/tickets.md](../vendor/tickets.md#populated--enriched-references).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A ticket and a ticket note are identified by `id`, not `_id`** — on every endpoint on this
> page. `Ticket` is built on `BaseSchemaOptions` (`src/core/base.schema.ts`), whose `toJSON`
> deletes `_id` and exposes the `id` virtual, so the write endpoints a customer has —
> `PATCH /:id`, `PATCH /:id/status` and `POST /:id/close` — return the document with
> **`id` alone**.
>
> The three enriched reads — create, list and detail — additionally carry a duplicate **`_id`**,
> because `TicketEnrichmentService` builds its payload with `toObject({ virtuals: true })`, which
> applies no transform. **Key on `id`**: it is the only identifier present on all of them. A
> client that keys on `_id` reads `undefined` the first time it patches a ticket.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/customer/tickets` | Create a ticket |
| `GET` | `/customer/tickets` | List the customer's tickets |
| `GET` | `/customer/tickets/reference/orders` | Reference lookup: the customer's orders |
| `GET` | `/customer/tickets/reference/products` | Reference lookup: products |
| `GET` | `/customer/tickets/:id` | Ticket details |
| `PATCH` | `/customer/tickets/:id` | Update editable fields |
| `PATCH` | `/customer/tickets/:id/status` | Change status |
| `POST` | `/customer/tickets/:id/close` | Close the ticket |
| `POST` | `/customer/tickets/:ticketId/notes` | Add a **public** note |
| `GET` | `/customer/tickets/:ticketId/notes` | List notes |
| `POST` | `/customer/tickets/:ticketId/attachments` | Attach a file (from `POST /api/files/upload`) |
| `GET` | `/customer/tickets/:ticketId/attachments` | List attachments |

### Customer-specific restrictions (differ from staff roles)
- **No `assign` and no `priority` endpoints** — customers cannot reassign or reprioritise tickets.
- **Notes are public-only** — `POST …/notes` always creates a public note (internal notes are rejected
  server-side). Customers never see internal staff notes.
- A customer sees only **their own** tickets.

### Example — create

```json
POST /api/customer/tickets
{
  "subject": "Order arrived damaged",
  "description": "One of the two items in order #ORD-5521 was cracked.",
  "type": "order_issue",
  "importance": "medium",
  "entityType": "ORDER",
  "entityId": "664ord..."
}
```

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "id": "664tkt...", "subject": "Order arrived damaged", "status": "open", "...": "..." } }
```

## Possible error codes

| `error.code` | Status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Body/query fails the schema |
