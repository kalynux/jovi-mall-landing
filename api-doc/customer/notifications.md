# Customer Notifications API

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — all six routes, the list query schema (including the `ticket` aggregate type) and the notification document shape, against `jovi-mall/src/modules/notifications/` (routes, controller, `models/customer-notification.model.ts`).

The customer's notification inbox and channel preferences. This is the **fourth** multi-channel notification stack on the platform, alongside vendor, agency and agent — customers previously received nothing at all except the COD delivery code.

> [!NOTE]
> Bookings are covered in [bookings.md](./bookings.md); orders in [orders.md](./orders.md).

## How delivery works

Every notification produces an **in-app record** — that is the durable one, and it is always written. On top of that:

| Channel | When it is used |
|---|---|
| **In-app** | Always. Never configurable. |
| **Push (FCM)** | Always, to every device the customer has registered. Best-effort. |
| **Email / Telegram / WhatsApp** | **At most one**, chosen by the customer, and only once that channel is verified. |

Enabling one secondary channel automatically disables the other two. Priority when resolving: telegram → email → whatsapp.

Copy is rendered in the customer's language (`customer.preferences.language`), in **en · fr · pt · es · ar**. Times are formatted in the customer's own `timezone`.

---

## What can and cannot be switched off

Preferences gate **progress reporting only**. Two groups always send, and no setting will silence them:

- **Money** — payment received, refund issued, refund pending, balance due.
- **Cancellations** — a vendor calling off an appointment or an order.

The reasoning: a customer is the *counterparty* to someone else's action here, not the owner of a dashboard. A silent refund is indistinguishable from a stolen payment, and a balance nobody was told about cannot fairly be chased.

| Preference key | Gates | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `bookingUpdates` | booking created · confirmed · rescheduled · completed | `true` |
| `bookingReminders` | the pre-appointment reminder | `true` |
| `orderUpdates` | order created · shipped · out for delivery · delivered · delivery failed | `true` |
| `marketing` | nothing yet — reserved so a future campaign cannot be bolted onto `orderUpdates` | **`false`** |

---

## Endpoints

All require a Bearer token with the **customer** role, and are scoped to the caller.

### List notifications

```http
GET /api/customer/notifications
```

| Query | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | number | Default `1` |
| `limit` | number | Default `20`, max `100` |
| `unreadOnly` | `'true'` \| `'false'` | Only unread rows |
| `aggregateType` | `booking` \| `order` \| `shipment` \| `payment` \| `ticket` | Narrow to one subject area. **`ticket` was added by GAP-012** and this row omitted it — a customer receiving ticket notifications had no way to filter to them. |

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      "type": "booking.reminder",
      "title": "Reminder: Haircut tomorrow",
      "message": "Your Haircut booking with Salon A is tomorrow (2026-08-10 14:00). If you cannot make it, please cancel so the slot can go to someone else.",
      "aggregateType": "booking",
      "aggregateId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439022",
      "action": { "label": "View booking", "path": "bookings/507f...", "url": "https://shop.example/bookings/507f..." },
      "deliveredVia": ["in-app", "push", "email"],
      "isRead": false,
      "readAt": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-08-09T13:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": { "total": 42, "page": 1, "limit": 20, "pages": 3, "unreadCount": 5 }
}
```

### Unread count

```http
GET /api/customer/notifications/unread-count
```

Returns `{ "success": true, "data": { "unreadCount": 5 } }`. Use this for a badge rather than fetching a page of rows to render one integer.

> ⚠ **`action` is OMITTED, not `null`, when a notification has nowhere to go**
> (`default: undefined` on the sub-schema). Test for the key before reading `action.label`.
> When present, `label` and `path` are always set; `url` is optional.

### Get preferences

```http
GET /api/customer/notifications/preferences
```

Creates defaults on first read. The `emailVerified` / `telegramVerified` / `whatsappVerified` flags are computed **live** from the customer record and telegram link — the stored values are a cache and are not authoritative.

### Update preferences

```http
PATCH /api/customer/notifications/preferences
```

```json
{
  "emailEnabled": true,
  "preferences": { "bookingReminders": false }
}
```

Enabling an **unverified** channel returns `400 CUSTOMER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_NOT_VERIFIED` rather than silently accepting it — an enabled channel that delivers nothing reads as the platform being broken.

### Mark read

```http
PATCH /api/customer/notifications/:id/read
PATCH /api/customer/notifications/read-all
```

## Situations

### Bookings

| Type | Sent when | Mutable |
|---|---|---|
| `booking.created` | The booking is placed. Says whether it is confirmed or awaiting the vendor. | `bookingUpdates` |
| `booking.confirmed` | The vendor accepted a `manual` booking. | `bookingUpdates` |
| `booking.rescheduled` | Moved to a new time. Carries **both** the old and new times. | `bookingUpdates` |
| `booking.cancelled` | Called off. Names who did it and where the money went, in one message. | **No** |
| `booking.completed` | The appointment happened and was settled. | `bookingUpdates` |
| `booking.reminder` | ~24h before `startAt`, from the reminder sweep. | `bookingReminders` |
| `booking.payment.received` | Payment succeeded. | **No** |
| `booking.balance.due` | The service cost more than quoted and a balance is payable. | **No** |
| `booking.refunded` | Money returned after a cancellation. | **No** |
| `booking.refund.pending` | A refund is owed but is being sent by hand. | **No** |

### Orders

| Type | Sent when | Mutable |
|---|---|---|
| `order.created` | The order is placed. | `orderUpdates` |
| `order.payment.received` | Payment succeeded. | **No** |
| `order.shipped` | The parcel left the vendor/depot (`picked_up`). | `orderUpdates` |
| `order.out_for_delivery` | An agent is carrying it (`in_transit`). | `orderUpdates` |
| `order.delivered` | Delivered. | `orderUpdates` |
| `order.delivery_failed` | An attempt failed. | `orderUpdates` |
| `order.cancelled` | Cancelled. | **No** |
| `order.refunded` | Refunded. | **No** |

> Only **four** shipment statuses reach the customer. `assigned`, `handing_over` and the rest are internal logistics; forwarding them would train people to ignore the channel that matters.

**Delivery messages carry the detail that makes them useful:**

- `order.shipped` prints the real tracking number.
- `order.out_for_delivery` tells COD customers to have the cash ready, with the amount still owed — a partially-paid COD order quotes what remains, not the full total. Prepaid orders get no cash sentence at all.
- `order.delivery_failed` explains why, in the customer's language. The agent's operational reason is rephrased for the person who was waiting in, and never accuses them: `customer_refused` reads "the delivery was declined at the door", not "you refused it". A reason-less report still gets a complete sentence. The agent's free-text `note` is internal and is **never** shown.

## Configuration

| Env var | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `STOREFRONT_URL` | Base URL for deep links in notifications. Unset ⇒ actions carry a relative `path` and no `url`. | — |
| `BOOKING_REMINDER_ENABLED` | Set `false` to stop the reminder sweep. | `true` |
| `BOOKING_REMINDER_LEAD_MINUTES` | How far ahead of `startAt` to remind. | `1440` (24h) |
| `BOOKING_REMINDER_INTERVAL_MS` | Sweep cadence — also the reminder's timing granularity. | `900000` (15 min) |

WhatsApp sends use the approved templates named `customer_*` (see `template-registry.ts`). Inside Meta's 24-hour service window a free-form message is sent instead.
