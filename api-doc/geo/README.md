# Geospatial Addresses & Address Search

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — the geocoding routes, response shapes and error codes
against `jovi-mall/src/modules/geo/` (`routes.ts`, `controllers/geo.controller.ts`) and
`src/core/geocoding/`. One correction: the closing claim that geo-tracker does "not address
resolution" is false — see the ⚠ at the foot of this page.

> Provider-agnostic address search + the shared **GeoAddress** value object that every address in
> jovi-mall now carries. Users keep typing free-form text; the backend turns it into map-grade
> candidates via the active geocoding provider, and the selected candidate is stored with full
> geospatial data — never plain text alone.

All endpoints use the standard envelope (see [../README.md](../README.md)). Auth: **any signed-in role**.

## Why this exists

Addresses used to be loose text with, at most, a bare coordinate. There was no formatted address, no
provider place id, and no structured admin breakdown, and nothing turned typed text into map results.
Now:

- **Vendor** business addresses, **agency** headquarters, **customer** saved addresses, order
  **pickup** snapshots, and the order **drop-off** all embed a `GeoAddress`.
- A single geocoding provider (default **Nominatim / OpenStreetMap**, keyless) resolves free-form text
  to candidates. Swapping to Google/Mapbox/HERE/Geoapify is a config change only (`GEO_PROVIDER`) —
  the API shape and every consumer stay identical. **No business logic ever depends on the provider.**

---

## The GeoAddress object

Stored verbatim wherever an address lives. `coordinates` is GeoJSON `[longitude, latitude]`.

```jsonc
{
  "formatted_address": "Rue de l'Université, Yaoundé, Cameroun",
  "coordinates": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [11.5174, 3.8480] }, // [lng, lat]
  "provider": "nominatim",              // which provider resolved it (informational)
  "provider_place_id": "way:12345678",  // provider's stable id (nullable)
  "components": {                        // structured admin breakdown — every part nullable
    "street": "Rue de l'Université",
    "neighbourhood": "Ngoa-Ekellé",
    "city": "Yaoundé",
    "region": "Centre",
    "country": "Cameroon",
    "country_code": "CM",               // ISO-3166-1 alpha-2
    "postal_code": null
  },
  "raw_input": "Rue de l'Université, Yaoundé", // what the user typed before selecting
  "resolved_at": "2026-07-18T10:20:30.000Z"    // server-assigned on store
}
```

When you **store** a GeoAddress (attach it to a profile address, or send it at checkout), send exactly
the candidate you got from search **plus** `raw_input`. `resolved_at` is server-assigned — do not send it.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/geo/search`

Turn free-form text into ranked candidate locations (the Google-Maps-style search box).

| Query | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | string (required) | The free-form text the user typed. |
| `limit` | integer 1–20 | Max candidates. Provider default (5) when omitted. |
| `country` | string | Comma-separated ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 codes to bias results, e.g. `cm,ng`. Defaults to the platform bias (`GEO_DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODES`, `cm`). |
| `lang` | string | Preferred result language, BCP-47 (e.g. `fr`). |

```jsonc
// GET /api/geo/search?q=Rue%20de%20l'Universit%C3%A9,%20Yaound%C3%A9&limit=5
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "provider": "nominatim",
    "query": "Rue de l'Université, Yaoundé",
    "results": [
      {
        "formatted_address": "Rue de l'Université, Yaoundé, Cameroun",
        "coordinates": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [11.5174, 3.8480] },
        "provider": "nominatim",
        "provider_place_id": "way:12345678",
        "components": { "street": "Rue de l'Université", "city": "Yaoundé", "region": "Centre", "country": "Cameroon", "country_code": "CM", "neighbourhood": null, "postal_code": null }
      }
      // …more candidates
    ]
  }
}
```

Each `results[]` entry is a **candidate** — the GeoAddress shape minus `raw_input`/`resolved_at`. To
store it, add `raw_input` (the user's `q`) and submit it to the owning endpoint (below).

### `GET /api/geo/reverse`

Turn a coordinate into its best-matching address (e.g. "use my current location").

| Query | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `lat` | number −90..90 (required) | Latitude. |
| `lng` | number −180..180 (required) | Longitude. |

```jsonc
// GET /api/geo/reverse?lat=3.8480&lng=11.5174
{ "success": true, "data": { "provider": "nominatim", "result": { /* one candidate, or null */ } } }
```

### Error codes

| `error.code` | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GEO_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Provider unreachable (network/timeout). Geo is off the critical path — retry; checkout/profile still work. |
| `GEO_SEARCH_FAILED` | 502 | Provider returned an error / unparseable response. |
| `GEO_PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED` | 500 | Configured provider has no adapter/credentials in this build. |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Bad query params (missing `q`, out-of-range `lat`/`lng`). |

---

## Where a GeoAddress is stored

Attach the selected candidate (as a `geo` field, or as the checkout drop-off) to any of these. The
legacy loose fields (`address_line1`, `city`, `location`, …) are **kept** for backward compatibility;
`geo` is the canonical record.

| Site | Endpoint | Field |
|---|---|---|
| Customer saved address | `POST /api/customer/addresses` | `geo` |
| Vendor business address | `PATCH /api/vendor/profile` (and onboarding step 3) | `business_addresses[].geo` |
| Agency HQ address | agency onboarding step 1 / `PATCH /api/agency/magazin` | `headquarters_addresses[].geo` (`location`, `region` and `city` are all **derived** from it) |
| Pickup location | derived from the vendor business address; **snapshotted** onto the order at checkout | `items[].delivery.pickup_location.address_snapshot.geo` |
| Drop-off | `POST /api/customer/orders/checkout` | `deliveryAddress` **or** `deliveryAddressId` → snapshotted to `order.delivery_address` |

### Checkout drop-off

`POST /api/customer/orders/checkout` now accepts (physical carts):

```jsonc
{
  "paymentMethod": "online",
  // ONE of the two (or neither → falls back to the customer's default saved address):
  "deliveryAddressId": "665f...c1",     // id of one of the customer's saved addresses
  "deliveryAddress": { /* a selected GeoAddress + raw_input */ }
}
```

The resolved GeoAddress is frozen onto every order in the checkout group as `order.delivery_address`,
so a later edit to the customer's saved addresses never rewrites past orders. Digital orders ignore it.

## Workflow — drop-off snapshot at checkout

    note over API,DB: geo-tracker may later read the drop-off coordinate for routing —<br/>no event-shape change; jovi-mall owns geocoding, geo-tracker owns routing.

## Provider configuration

Selected once at boot from env (see `.env.example`). Mirrors the storage-provider pattern.

| Env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GEO_PROVIDER` | `nominatim` | `nominatim` \| `google` \| `mapbox` \| `here` \| `geoapify`. Only `nominatim` has an adapter in this build. |
| `GEO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Per-request timeout. |
| `GEO_DEFAULT_LIMIT` | `5` | Default candidate count. |
| `GEO_DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODES` | `cm` | Comma-separated ISO-2 bias. Blank = worldwide. |
| `GEO_NOMINATIM_BASE_URL` | public OSM | Or a self-hosted mirror. |
| `GEO_NOMINATIM_USER_AGENT` | identifying UA | **Required by Nominatim's usage policy.** |
| `GEO_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | The result cache — see below. |
| `GEO_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `86400` | How long a resolved result is kept. |
| `GEO_CACHE_NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS` | `600` | How long an empty result is kept — deliberately shorter. |
| `GEO_CACHE_REVERSE_PRECISION` | `4` | Decimals a reverse coordinate is rounded to (~11 m). |

### Results are cached, and a client cannot tell

Both endpoints are served through a Redis result cache
([ADR-A04](../../docs/ADR-A04-GEOCODING.md) D-1). **Nothing about the contract changes** — the
response shape, the `provider` field on every candidate, and the error codes are identical on a
hit and on a miss, and there is no cache header, no `cached: true` flag and no way to bypass it
from a request. Two things follow that are worth knowing anyway:

- **A repeated search is fast and free.** Typing the same street twice, or two customers typing
  it at all, costs one provider call. Do not build your own client-side cache on top of this one
  unless you are trying to save a network round trip rather than a provider call.
- **The cache fails open.** If Redis is unavailable the provider is called directly — an address
  search never fails *because* of the cache, and never hangs on it.

`GEO_CACHE_NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS` is the one number a client's behaviour can notice: an address
that returns no candidates is remembered for ten minutes by default, so an address added to
OpenStreetMap in the last few minutes may take that long to appear. It is short precisely so that
window stays short.

The seam is `IGeocodingProvider` (`src/core/geocoding/`). Adding Google/Mapbox/HERE/Geoapify is one
adapter file + a factory case; **no consumer changes**. Because geocoding is an address concern and
jovi-mall owns addresses, the whole provider abstraction **for the order and profile model** lives
in jovi-mall.

> ⚠ **This sentence ended "— geo-tracker owns live positions and road networks, not address
> resolution" until 2026-09-08, and that last clause is false.** geo-tracker exposes
> `GET /routing/geocode` and `GET /routing/reverse-geocode`, registered at
> `geo-tracker/internal/modules/routing/delivery/http/routes.go:17-18` and implemented against the

> **The narrower claim is the true one, and it is the one that matters here:** resolving an address
> *for an order or a profile* is jovi-mall's alone, and the `GeoAddress` value object above has no
