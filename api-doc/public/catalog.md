# Public catalog (no auth)

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — every route, query parameter, response field, enum
and error code on this page, against `jovi-mall/src/modules/catalog/` (routes, controller,
validators, service, `dto/public-product.dto.ts`, `read-models/public-display-price.ts`).

**No authentication.** These endpoints are readable by a logged-out visitor, and they exist
for the storefront: it browses, searches and opens products, so it needs to *read* the
catalogue rather than render a mock.

Everything here is a product a vendor has deliberately put on sale, or a store that sells
one. Nothing owner-scoped is reachable; see [the rule for this prefix](./README.md).

## Base path

```
/api/public
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/public/products` | Browse, search, filter, sort — and the sitemap's product feed |
| GET | `/api/public/stores/:storeSlug/products/:productSlug` | **The canonical product page** |
| GET | `/api/public/products/:productId` | The same product, by id — for deep links |
| GET | `/api/public/products/:productId/related` | **"Customers also bought"** — the related strip |
| GET | `/api/public/products/by-ids` | **Batch hydration** — many ids → the same browse rows, in your order |
| GET | `/api/public/variants/by-sku/:sku` | A printed product code → the variant it names |
| GET | `/api/public/categories` | Category chips, with counts |
| GET | `/api/public/stores` | Store directory + the sitemap's store feed |
| GET | `/api/public/stores/:slug` | One store |
| GET | `/api/public/stores/:slug/products` | One store's grid |

All use the standard [response envelope](../README.md#4--the-response-envelope)
and send `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`.

> **Why the 5-minute cache.** It is the window in which a newly published product, a price
> change, or a vendor going on holiday is invisible to the storefront. Your own revalidation
> adds to it — so this is *not* instant and must not be described to a vendor as instant. It
> is the trade for not putting an unauthenticated endpoint straight onto Mongo on every page
> view.

## The four model decisions, as built

Read these before the endpoints; each one answers a question the shapes below will raise.

### 1. Products are nested under their store, and that is the canonical URL

`Product.slug` is unique **per vendor** (`{ vendorId: 1, slug: 1 }`), not globally — two
vendors may both own `blue-shirt`. So there is no such thing as `/products/:slug`, and the
addressable form is:

```
/api/public/stores/maison-bella/products/blue-shirt
```

Emit that from every internal link, the sitemap and the JSON-LD `url`.
`GET /api/public/products/:productId` (an ObjectId) exists so a link held in an order, an
email or a share sheet resolves without the client having to know the store slug — it is a
fallback, not an alternative.

*(This is BACKEND-SHOP-REQUIREMENTS §2.6 Option B. No slug migration was run, and product
slugs remain per-vendor unique.)*

### 2. What is visible is one predicate, and `active` already guarantees a great deal

A product is public when it is `status: "active"`, not soft-deleted, not suspended, **and**
its vendor is not suspended. Nothing else appears — anywhere, on any of these endpoints.

`active` carries more weight than it looks: a product cannot reach it without a non-empty
description, at least one variant, `price > 0` on every active variant, a resolvable active
default variant, a vendor in good standing, and — for physical products — a live delivery
agency, an approved vendor↔agency connection and a valid pickup location. So a row you
receive here is one the platform believes is genuinely sellable.

> **A store's vendor is checked as "not suspended", not "is active".** A vendor who never
> verified their email sits at `pending_verification`, and their products are legitimately
> `active`. Gating on `active` would have hidden their store while their products stayed in
> the grid.

### 3. `inStock` is a boolean, and there is no count

Availability is `stock − units held by in-flight checkouts`. That number is real, but it is
**not published**: a precise count on a 5-minute-cached page is a promise that is wrong the
moment it is read. Ask for `?inStock=true` to narrow; render "in stock" / "out of stock",
never "3 left".

### 4. A closed store still sells — the flag is yours to render

`store.isOpen: false` is a vendor's vacation mode. It does **not** suspend their products,
and they are still listed and still resolve, because hiding them would break every live link
and sitemap entry for the duration of a holiday. Render the flag (and disable add-to-cart if
you like) — the backend does not block the cart on it.

---

## GET /api/public/products

### Query parameters

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `q` | string ≤ 200 | — | Full-text over title, tags and description. See the note below. |
| `category` | string | — | Exact match on the free-text `category` field |
| `type` | `physical` \| `digital` \| `service` | — | Repeatable (`?type=a&type=b`) **or** comma-separated |
| `storeSlug` | string | — | Narrow to one store |
| `minPrice` / `maxPrice` | integer | — | Whole units. `minPrice > maxPrice` is a `400`, not an empty page |
| `inStock` | `"true"` | — | Only `true` narrows; `false` means "don't filter" |
| `sort` | enum | `newest` | `newest` \| `price_asc` \| `price_desc` \| `relevance` |
| `page` | integer ≥ 1 | `1` | |
| `limit` | integer 1–100 | `20` | |

> **`q` is a MongoDB `$text` search, not a substring match.** It matches whole words:
> searching `dres` will **not** find "dress". This is the first text index in the platform,
> and it exists because the alternative — an unanchored `$regex` — cannot use an index (a
> collection scan on an unauthenticated endpoint) and carries no relevance score, which
> would leave `sort=relevance` with nothing to rank by. Stemming is disabled, because one
> stemmer would be wrong for four of the five locales vendors write in.

> **There is no `sort=popularity`.** Nothing tracks sales — `Product.lastOrderedAt` exists
> and is read by nobody — so the option would be a lie or a silent alias. It is refused with
> a `400` rather than accepted and ignored.

### Success — `200 OK`

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439066",
      "slug": "ankara-wax-print-maxi-dress",
      "title": "Ankara Wax Print Maxi Dress",
      "type": "physical",
      "category": "Fashion",
      "tags": ["wax", "handmade"],

      "price": 24000,               // resolved from the default variant — see "bargainable" below
      "compareAtPrice": 30000,      // null when not discounted
      "currency": "XAF",
      "priceRange": { "min": 24000, "max": 38000 },  // OMITTED when every variant costs the same
      "inStock": true,

      "image": {                    // thumbnail only; full gallery on the detail
        "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439030",
        "key": "images/abc123.jpg",
        "url": "https://…/products/abc123.jpg",
        "access": "public",
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
        "size": 84213,
        "originalName": "cover.jpg"
      },

      "rating": { "average": 4.25, "count": 12 },   // null when nobody has reviewed it

      "store": { "slug": "maison-bella", "name": "Maison Bella", "isOpen": true },

      "freeDelivery": false,
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-30T09:20:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": { "total": 120, "page": 1, "limit": 20, "pages": 6 }
}
```

- `image` is `null` when the product has no usable image — the key is always present.
- `priceRange` is **omitted** when there is one price, rather than sent as `{min: x, max: x}`.
- `rating` is `null` when the product has no published reviews — **never**
  `{ average: 0, count: 0 }`. The key is always present. That null is what governs
  `aggregateRating` in your JSON-LD; see [SEO](#seo) and [reviews.md](../reviews.md).
- An empty result is `data: []` with `meta.total: 0`. Never a 404.
- Build the product URL as `/shop/stores/{store.slug}/products/{slug}` — see decision 1.

### ⚠ A bargainable variant is quoted at its ASK

Some variants carry a vendor-configured haggling window, and the price you are given for one
is the **top** of that window — the vendor's ask — not the bottom. The bottom is the vendor's
floor: the number they will not go below in a negotiation the shopper is the other side of.
**It is never published on any public route**, under any key, and there is no field on this
surface from which it can be derived.

Nothing about the response *shape* changes, and that is deliberate: `price`, `compareAtPrice`,
`priceRange`, the `price_asc`/`price_desc` sorts and the `minPrice`/`maxPrice` filters all move
together, so a client cannot end up comparing one kind of price against another. In particular
**a filtered page is still guaranteed to quote prices inside the band you asked for** — filter
`maxPrice=40000` and nothing displaying 45 000 comes back.

⚠ **A configured window is not always an effective one, so "has a window" is not the
condition.** The rule is `isBargainEffective = vectorisationEnabled === true && bargain != null`
(`src/modules/catalog/domain/services/bargain-price.rule.ts:162-167`): a window on a product
whose **vectorisation opt-in is off** is kept, fully validated, and **inert** — and such a
variant is shelved at its ordinary `price`, not at its ask. Nothing on this surface lets you
tell the two apart, and nothing needs to; it matters only if you are reconciling a shop price
against what a vendor configured, where the flag is the missing half of the explanation.
(The vendor dashboard’s own docs publish a `bargainable` boolean; this surface deliberately
does not.)

Three consequences worth knowing:

- **There is no `bargainable` flag on this surface, and no "make an offer" control.**
  Negotiation happens in chat only. If you want one, ask — it is a deliberate omission rather
  than an oversight, and publishing it is a decision about this file.
- **`compareAtPrice` is suppressed on a bargainable variant unless it is strictly above the
  ask.** A vendor may legitimately hold a "was" price that sits above their floor and below
  their ask; publishing that pair would render a strikethrough *beneath* the live price.
- **A cart line is not bound by any of this.** The price a variant is *shelved* at and the
  price a line is *sold* at are resolved by different code, and a negotiated line carries a
  number the shop never displayed. See [Customer → Cart](../customer/cart.md).

## GET /api/public/products/by-ids

Batch hydration: the same rows as the browse grid, for a set of ids the caller already
holds, in **one** request instead of N.

```
GET /api/public/products/by-ids?ids=507f1f77bcf86cd799439066,507f1f77bcf86cd799439067
GET /api/public/products/by-ids?ids=507f…66&ids=507f…67          // repeated param, same thing
```

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ids` | string | Repeated **or** comma-separated ObjectIds. 1–50 per request. Duplicates are collapsed. |

### Success — `200 OK`

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "products": [ /* product list rows — the SAME shape GET /api/public/products returns */ ],
    "missing": ["507f1f77bcf86cd799439067"]
  }
}
```

### Three properties that are the contract

**1. Order is yours.** Rows come back in the order you sent the ids. A relevance ranking
computed elsewhere therefore survives hydration with no re-sorting — which is what this
route exists for.

**2. `missing` is an answer, not an error.** An id that is no longer publishable — archived,
suspended, deleted, or belonging to a suspended vendor — is named in `missing` rather than
404ing the whole request. The same visibility predicate every route on this router uses
decides it (`public-catalog.filter.ts`), so this doubles as a **freshness gate**: a caller
holding a stale list learns which entries have gone off sale.

**3. It is the same DTO as the browse grid**, built by the same decorator. `inStock` is a
boolean and never a count, `priceRange` is omitted when there is one price, `rating` is
`null` rather than `{average: 0, count: 0}` — all exactly as in
[GET /api/public/products](#get-apipublicproducts).

### Who this is for

The **n8n product-search tool**. It retrieves ranked product ids out of the pgvector index
(`api-doc/n8n/vectoriser/README.md` § 13) and comes here for what those products currently
cost and whether they are actually in stock — because the vector index is a snapshot and
stock in particular only refreshes when a product is re-vectorised. Retrieval happens in
pgvector; **price and availability stay this service's answer.**

It is not limited to that caller, and the storefront has its own uses: rehydrating the
**recently-viewed** and **saved** strips (which store ids, not rows — see
[customer/saved-and-viewed.md](../customer/saved-and-viewed.md)), a re-render of a cached
grid, or a saved comparison. Anything holding a list of ids wants this rather than a loop.

### Errors

| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `ids` absent, empty, over 50, or containing something that is not a 24-hex id |

An id that is well-formed but matches nothing is **not** an error — it lands in `missing`.

⚠ **This route is declared before `/products/:productId`, and that ordering is load-bearing.**
Both are two segments, so Express resolves them by declaration order alone. Reversed,
`by-ids` is read as a product id and every request here answers `400`. Pinned by
`verify:storefront`.

## GET /api/public/stores/:storeSlug/products/:productSlug

### ⚠️ Select variants on `optionValueIds`, never on a rebuilt signature

`ProductVariant.optionSignature` (`"size:large|color:red"`) is **not published**, and you
must not reconstruct it. Renaming an option value is a documented *safe* operation that
deliberately does not rewrite the stored signature — so after a rename the signature still
says `color:red` while every screen says `crimson`, and a client matching on displayed text
fails to find a variant that exists.

Match on `optionValueIds` (a set), or read the pre-joined `options[]` on each variant, which
is there so you never have to join anything yourself.

### ⚠️ A service variant's `price` is a UNIT RATE

It is the price per `durationMinutes`, prorated by the actual elapsed duration and then
surcharged by peak hours — printing it as "the price" misquotes the customer. Render
`priceFrom` with `priceUnit` ("from 24,000 XAF · per 1 h"), or format your own label from
`durationMinutes`, which is the authoritative number. `priceUnit` is an English convenience
string and is not localized.

### Simple-mode products

`options: []` and exactly one variant. Skip the picker entirely.

### Policies are structured, not prose

BACKEND-SHOP-REQUIREMENTS §2.2 sketched `returnPolicy` as a string. There is no prose field
anywhere to render from — `IVendorReturnPolicy` is structured — so a string would have had
to be generated on the server, in one language, for a five-locale storefront. You get the
facts and phrase them. Either block is `null` when the vendor has not configured one; no
defaults are invented.

### Errors

| `error.code` | Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `CATALOG_PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Absent, soft-deleted, draft, archived, suspended, or its vendor is suspended |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Malformed slug or id |

> A non-public product returns **404, never 403** — a 403 would confirm the id is real,
> which is exactly what a competitor enumerating a vendor's unreleased catalogue wants.

---

## GET /api/public/products/:productId/related

The related-products strip for a product page. No auth, no side effects — nothing records that
you asked.

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    { "product": { "id": "68a2…", "slug": "black-belt", "title": "Black Belt", "...": "…" }, "orders": 14 },
    { "product": { "...": "…" }, "orders": 9 }
  ],
  "meta": { "source": "co_purchase" }
}
```

Each `product` is a **product list row** — the same shape as `GET /api/public/products` returns,
documented in full there.

### ⚠ `meta.source` is part of the contract, not diagnostics

There are two signals behind this endpoint and they answer different questions. The response says
which one produced the list, and **your headings must follow it**:

| `meta.source` | What it means | `orders` | Suggested heading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `co_purchase` | Genuinely behavioural — a count of past **paid** orders that contained both products | a number | "Frequently bought together" |
| `same_category` | The fallback: other products in the same category, most recently ordered first | **always `null`** | "More in this category" |

A strip headed *"customers also bought"* that is really ordered by category recency is a claim
about other shoppers that is not true. That is why the label is published rather than kept
server-side — the platform will not make the claim for you, and it will not let you make it by
accident.

`same_category` is the common case on a young catalogue: most products have never been bought
alongside anything yet.

### What `orders` is, precisely

The number of **distinct past orders** that contained this product and the subject together.
Buying three of something in one order is one piece of evidence, not three.

> ⚠ **It is computed from a bounded sample**, not from all of history: the most recent
> `RELATED_PRODUCTS_ORDER_SAMPLE` (default 500) paid orders containing the subject, within
> `RELATED_PRODUCTS_WINDOW_DAYS` (default 365). It is evidence of a pattern, not an audited total,
> and should not be rendered as an exact lifetime figure ("bought together 14 times" is fine;
> "14 customers" is not).

### Other things worth knowing

- **The subject is never in its own strip.**
- **Nothing off sale ever appears.** The same publishable predicate as the rest of this document —
  draft, archived, suspended, soft-deleted, and suspended-vendor products are all excluded, and a
  product that goes off sale disappears from the strip immediately even though the ranking behind
  it is cached.
- Unlike a [wishlist entry](../customer/saved-and-viewed.md), an unavailable product is **dropped,
  not degraded**. Nobody chose this list; a card that cannot be bought is just broken.
- **An empty `data` is a `200`**, never a 404. "Nothing is related to this yet" is a successful
  answer, and a young catalogue produces it often.
- Up to `RELATED_PRODUCTS_LIMIT` (default 8) entries.
- The **ranking** is cached for six hours; the **cards are not** — price, stock and store state are
  read live on every request, so this endpoint never serves a stale price.

| `error.code` | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CATALOG_PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | The *subject* is not public. Same 404-never-403 rule as everywhere here |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Malformed id |

---

## GET /api/public/variants/by-sku/:sku

A product code — off a package, a label, an advertisement, a WhatsApp message — resolved to
the variant it names.

**It exists because search cannot do this.** `?q=` is a MongoDB `$text` search over title,
tags and description; it does **not** index SKU and will not match one. A customer typing a
real code got an empty result indistinguishable from "we do not sell that".

### ⚠ It answers a RESOLUTION, not a product card

A SKU names one specific variant, and that is very often **not** the default variant a card
quotes. Answering with a card would show the wrong price to precisely the customer who typed
a precise code. So this returns the variant's own `price`, its own `inStock`, and the ids to
fetch the full product with — nothing else.

That `price` follows the same rule as everywhere else on this surface: on a **bargainable**
variant it is the vendor's ask, never their floor. See
[A bargainable variant is quoted at its ASK](#-a-bargainable-variant-is-quoted-at-its-ask).

```jsonc
// GET /api/public/variants/by-sku/CAPTURE-SKU-DOC-DRESS-WAX-M  →  200
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "productId": "6a8f497787a554ec589db76c",
    "variantId": "6a8f497787a554ec589db76d",
    "sku": "CAPTURE-SKU-DOC-DRESS-WAX-M",
    "title": "Ankara Wax Print Maxi Dress",
    "variantName": "Size: M",
    "price": 24000,
    "currency": "XAF",
    "inStock": true,
    "store": { "slug": "capture-sku-doc-maison-bella", "name": "Maison Bella" }
  }
}
```

*(Captured from a running server, fixtures and all.)*

`sku` is echoed **as stored**, which is not always what was sent — see the case rule below.
`variantName` follows the same rule as the product page's variant list: the vendor's own name,
else the option selection spelled out (`"Size: M, Colour: Red"`), else the SKU itself.

### Case: three spellings are tried, and the one you sent wins

`ProductVariant.sku` is a **case-sensitive** unique index and vendors type SKUs however they
like, while a customer is reading a code into a phone keyboard that capitalises. So the value
you send, its uppercase form and its lowercase form are all tried, in one indexed lookup, and
if more than one exists **the spelling you sent is the one that answers**.

⚠ **A mixed-case SKU only resolves when typed exactly.** `Dress-Wax-M` stored, `DRESS-WAX-M`
typed, is a miss — the three candidates are as-typed, all-upper and all-lower, and none of
them is the stored mixture. This is deliberate: a genuinely case-insensitive match cannot use
the unique index, which would turn every mistyped code on an unauthenticated route into a
collection scan. Vendors who want their codes to be typeable should keep them in one case.

### Errors

| Code | Status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `CATALOG_PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Unknown code — **or** its product is draft, archived, suspended, deleted, or its vendor is suspended |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Empty, or longer than 64 characters |

⚠ **The 404 is deliberately ambiguous**, exactly as it is on the product reads: a code that
resolves to something withdrawn must be indistinguishable from a code that never existed, or
the endpoint becomes an oracle for enumerating an unreleased catalogue.

A SKU containing `/` cannot be addressed here — it would split the path. Percent-encode it
(`%2F`); Express decodes the segment before the route sees it.

## GET /api/public/categories

`Product.category` is a plain indexed string; there is no Category collection, model or
taxonomy anywhere. The chip list is therefore derived, over exactly the browse filter — so a
category whose every product is a draft does not appear.

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    { "name": "Fashion", "productCount": 48 },
    { "name": "Home",    "productCount": 31 }
  ]
}
```

A bare array, sorted by count descending then name. No `meta` — it is a small complete set,
not a page.

## GET /api/public/stores

The directory, and the sitemap's source of store URLs.

### Query parameters

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `q` | string ≤ 200 | — | Substring over the store name (escaped) |
| `city` | string | — | Case-insensitive exact match on the vendor's city |
| `page` / `limit` | integer | `1` / `20` | `limit` capped at 100 |

> **Stores with no publishable products are excluded here.** An empty storefront is a
> soft-404 to a crawler, and emitting its URL in a sitemap asks Google to index a dead page.
> `GET /stores/:slug` does **not** apply that rule — a shopper following a link from an order
> should read "nothing for sale right now", not hit a dead page.

## GET /api/public/stores/:slug

```jsonc
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "slug": "maison-bella",
    "name": "Maison Bella",
    "description": "Contemporary African fashion, handmade in Douala.",
    "logo":   { /* FileDetail | null */ },
    "banner": { /* FileDetail | null */ },
    "isOpen": true,
    "supportEmail": "…", "supportPhone": "…", "supportWhatsapp": "…",
    "country": "CM",
    "city": "Douala",
    "verified": true,
    "productCount": 48,
    "memberSince": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

`404 STORE_NOT_FOUND` when the slug is unknown or the vendor is suspended.

> **`city` is the only address component published, deliberately.** A vendor's
> `business_addresses[]` are the places they ship from — a home or a warehouse, with a street
> line and exact coordinates. A shopper needs the city; the rest is a private address.

## GET /api/public/stores/:slug/products

The same query contract as `GET /api/public/products` minus `storeSlug`, and the same row
shape. `404 STORE_NOT_FOUND` if the store is not public — rather than an empty grid, which
would say "this seller has nothing" about a suspended vendor.

## SEO

- `sku` **is** published per variant. It is already globally unique and already shown to the
  customer on cart and order lines, so `Offer.sku` is safe to emit.
- `aggregateRating` — **emit it if and only if `rating` is non-null on the response.**
  This line used to read "stays omitted: there is no review system". There is one now
  (Phase 6 · 6.E.4, see [reviews.md](../reviews.md)), and the rule that replaced the
  blanket omission is deliberately shaped so a client cannot get it wrong: the backend
  **never sends a zero-count summary**. A product nobody has reviewed carries
  `rating: null`, exactly as one with no rating data at all would, so there is nothing to
  build an `aggregateRating` from and no branch to remember. Publishing invented review
  counts is still a Google review-snippet spam-policy violation that earns a manual
  action — do not synthesise `ratingValue: 0` / `reviewCount: 0` from a null.
- `updatedAt` on every product row is a real `lastModified` for the sitemap.

## Rate limiting

`/api/public/*` has its own IP-scoped bucket (`RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC_PER_MIN`, default 3000/min)
**in addition to** the global 1200/min backstop — so the effective ceiling is the lower of
the two. The separate bucket exists so anonymous browse traffic cannot exhaust the global
counter on behalf of the signed-in shoppers sharing an office NAT or a mobile carrier.
See [rate-limits.md](../rate-limits.md).

## Not built (deliberately)

- ~~**Related products / "customers also bought"**~~ — **built** (Phase 6 · 6.E.3).
  `GET /api/public/products/:productId/related`, above. Note the line this replaces was wrong on
  its own terms: `Product.lastOrderedAt` was already read, by the file-cleanup inactivity sweep,
  and is stamped on every product of a freshly-paid order — which is what made it usable as the
  fallback's ordering signal without inventing anything.
- **A "customers who viewed this also viewed" strip** — not built, and not a small addition
  disguised as one. Recently-viewed rows are per-customer and behind a session
  ([customer/saved-and-viewed.md](../customer/saved-and-viewed.md)); deriving a public signal from
  them means aggregating browsing behaviour across people, which is a privacy decision rather than
  a query.
- ~~**Reviews and ratings**~~ — **built** (Phase 6 · 6.E.4). `GET /api/public/products/:productId/reviews`
  serves the published product reviews and the rating breakdown; every product row and
  detail carries `rating`. Contract: [reviews.md](../reviews.md).
- **A stock count** — see decision 3. `inStock` is the honest answer.
- ⚠ **`bargain`** — **this entry was WRONG until 2026-09-08 and said the opposite of what the
  API does.** It read *"not published, pending a decision about whether the range is
  buyer-facing or a vendor-side floor."* **That decision was taken on 2026-09-07 and went both
  ways, one half each.** The *window* is still not published — no `bargain` object, no
  `minPrice`, no `maxPrice` key — but its **top** (`maxPrice`) is now **what `price` quotes**
  for a bargainable variant, and `variant.price` became the vendor's floor, which stays
  server-side forever.

  **`price`, `priceMin`/`priceMax`, the `price_asc`/`price_desc` sorts, the `minPrice`/`maxPrice`
  filter band and the by-SKU price all moved together**, so a filtered page still only contains
  products whose displayed price is inside the band you asked for. `compareAtPrice` is now
  suppressed on a bargainable variant unless strictly above the ask.

  **Nothing to change if you render these fields as given.** Re-check any price you cache or
  derive client-side. The full rule, with the one precondition that is easy to miss, is
  [A bargainable variant is quoted at its ASK](#-a-bargainable-variant-is-quoted-at-its-ask)
  above; the migration note written for this app is
  [Storefront price semantics](../FRONTEND-CHANGELOG-storefront-price-semantics.md).
- **A `bargainable` flag** — not published, and unlike the entry above **this one is still
  open**. Negotiation is chat-only, so the storefront has nothing to *do* with the flag today;
  the accepted cost is that a shopper cannot tell a negotiable price from a fixed one. That is
  a product decision rather than a technical gap — if you want the badge, ask.
- **Product-text translation** — `title`/`description`/`category`/`tags`/`seo.*` are plain
  strings with no `Accept-Language` handling. The platform's position is that product text is
  **vendor-authored in one language**, and `contentLanguage` says which so you can label it
  honestly. A translation system is a separate piece of work.
